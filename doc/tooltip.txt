                                                                *tooltip.nvim*

This plugin will output in a floating window any stdout or stderr of the current file when it is
ran. See examples below:

                                                             *tooltip.setup()*
tooltip.setup({config})

  This is the initial function where the command to be executed for each file extension will be defined.

  Parameters: ~
  - {config}  Map defining the config for tooltips. Keys:
              - patterns: Map with the file extension as the key and the
                command to be ran as the value.
                  Note: the value representing the command will be formated 
                  following regular c printf rules, replacing the %s with the file to be
                  run. >

    Example.
    
    tooltip.setup({
      patterns = {
        [".js"] = "node %s",
        [".rb"] = "ruby %s",
      },
    })
<

                                                              *tooltip.show()*
tooltip.show()
  
  Will get the current file in the buffer of the current window get the
  command to execute it (if set up with `tooltip.setup()`), run the command
  and output to stdout/stderr to a buffer and then show that buffer at the pos
  the cursor is at.

  Return: ~
  
  - If a command is not set up for the current file pattern, an error will
    show up saying so. Otherwise it will return nil.

                                                             *tooltip.close()*
tooltip.close() 

  Will close the window and delete the buffer that was used to show the output
  of the program. 

  Note: `<leader>q` is automatically added as a keymap to the buffer to call
  this function.
